# Temple Contact


## Motivation

Da-Chih Temple (大智寺), which is located in Chubei, Hsinchu County, wants to have a simple system that can manage its puja information. Therefore, they asked me to create a simple system with graph user interface, so that they can easily manage the information of puja participants. That's why this system is created.
